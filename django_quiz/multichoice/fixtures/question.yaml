      rekommendera att man tar tunnelbanan eftersom tågen går oftare än bussarna.
      Ta vilket södergående tåg som helst från T-Centralen och stig av vid Slussen.
      Gå ut genom uppgången till Götgatan och ta sedan till vänster. Gå Götgatan söderut
      i ungefär fem minuter, tills du kommer till Högbergsgatan. Ta av till vänster.
